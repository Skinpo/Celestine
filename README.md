- This is my very first website to be built after my crash course on html and css.
- This website is responsive and mobile friendly (though this is an uncompleted version of it)
- The about us page was designed by me and not part of the original design
- Subsequent branches will carry the concluded versions 
- Note (I am just uploading this here beacuse I just learnt how to use github)

<!---
Skinpo/Skinpo is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.

- In this branch I am making this site responsive (mobile version)
